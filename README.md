# Safeguard
## In Progress
A game that simulates the spread of disease across multiple cities and the effects of vaccinations.
It was produced during Imperial College Health Hack 2019 by Vishwam Garg, Raghav Khanna, Jonathan Longman and Luke Texon.
It is programmed in Unity.

## Overview
A disease is spreading and it’s ravaging the world! It’s up to your expertise and logical thinking to minimise the damage and stop the disease! 

You’re in control of the world’s health division: purchasing healthcare, arranging vaccinations and even going as far as closing off a country’s borders all in an attempt to prevent a pandemic. But it’s not only the disease you have to worry about! Performing drastic or unnecessary actions leave a bad impression on the population, lowering their happiness level! 

## TODO
Improve vaccination and medication systems and how they interact with money
Improve income system
Implement lethal diseases and a loss mechanic when all population is dead
Implement happiness level and the effects of low happiness
