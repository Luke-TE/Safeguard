# Safeguard
## In Progress
A Unity simulation and game that demonstrates the effect of vaccines on a distributed population and simulates the spread of disease across multiple cities by calculating the probability of individual infection (using the SIR model of infection)  
It was produced during Imperial College Health Hack 2019 by Vishwam Garg, Raghav Khanna, Jonathan Longman and Luke Texon.  
It is programmed in Unity.  

## Overview
A disease is spreading and it’s ravaging the world! It’s up to your expertise and logical thinking to minimise the damage and stop the disease! 

You’re in control of the world’s health division: purchasing healthcare, arranging vaccinations and even going as far as closing off a country’s borders all in an attempt to prevent a pandemic. But it’s not only the disease you have to worry about! Performing drastic or unnecessary actions leave a bad impression on the population, lowering their happiness level! 

## TODO
-Improve vaccination and medication systems and how they interact with money  
-Improve income system  
-Implement lethal diseases and a loss mechanic when all population is dead  
-Implement happiness level and the effects of low happiness such as antivaxxers  
-Improve UI  
-Add content to settings screen
